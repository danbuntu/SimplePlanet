SimplePie 1.0 by Dan Attwood 2011 - danattwood@gmail.com


Legal
-------------
I hereby release my changes made into SimplePie 1.7.2 under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU/LGPL)

Prerequisites
------------
A web server
PHP
MySQL


Install
-------------

Copy the files to a web available location
Make sure that the cache and feed.xml files are writeable by the web server
Run the database.sql script to create planet_rss database and tables
Open and edit the config.php file as needed

Go to yoursiteurl/manage_feeds.php to add/ delete new feeds and users

The default username is 'admin' and the default password is 'simple'
I recommend that you create a new admin user and delete the default one


Notes
---------

I originally created this for the Mahara e-portfolio system. However the rss feeds that Mahara generates don't play nicely with simplepie or magpie. I therefore had to create Feedburner feeds from the Mahara ones and feed these feeds into SimplePlanet
